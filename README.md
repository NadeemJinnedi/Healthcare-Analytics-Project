# Healthcare Analytics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on healthcare data engineering and analysis. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle encompasses individual medical costs billed by health insurance, including fields such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region, and charges.

## Files Included
- Python script for ingesting and transforming the dataset using Azure Databricks.
- SQL queries for analyzing the transformed data in Azure Synapse Analytics.

## Project Tasks
### 1. Ingestion and ETL
- The dataset was ingested using Azure Data Factory, transformed, and stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- ETL processes were implemented on Azure Databricks, ensuring optimal data quality and integrity.
- Transformed data was stored back in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

### 2. Data Quality Checks
- Comprehensive data quality checks were implemented to verify the accuracy of the transformation logic output.
- Null value checks and transformation logic verification were incorporated to ensure data reliability.

### 3. Data Analysis
- Synapse Analytics was leveraged for in-depth data analysis using SQL queries.
- Market dynamics for health insurance plans were explored, and a targeted marketing strategy was devised.
- The distribution and characteristics of health insurance plans across states and age groups were analyzed.
- Recommendations were made for the top 5 avenues where marketing effort should be spent by plan, age, and state.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Data Accuracy
- The precision and fidelity of the transformed data were rigorously validated to meet project specifications.
### 2. Code Quality
- The Databricks notebook is meticulously structured, and SQL queries are optimized for clarity and efficiency.
### Additional Notes
